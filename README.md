*After installation, Magic Remove will appear as button in the app palette on the right side (Cmd-Opt-P).*

### Usage

**Multiple-master deletion:** Select any number of nodes, anchors or components in Edit view and press *Magic Remove.* The selected nodes will be deleted on all compatible masters,

**Remove multiple nodes and keep shape:** The same behaviour you have when you select and delete an individual node, just for many nodes at once. Works for single master and multiple masters.

2. Find *Magic Remove* and click the *Install* button
3. Restart Glyphs.app
